This ADI AXI DMAC IIO client driver and test were created to ease transfer of
data between the PS and PL on Zynq and other such devices.

Build:

Edit make file and set the following:
	CROSS_CC to cross compiler or target compiler
	TARGET_ARCH to target
	TARGET_ROOT to target root for cross comiling or empty
	KERNELDIR to target kernel directory

PL & Devicetree Notes:

	See target.tcl for hints on how to design the PL portion.
	See target.dtsi on how to tell the kernel about the devices.

Test:
	Insert module and run test

Test Notes:
	When using iio_axi_dmac_test in a loopback configuration, remeber to
	start both receiver and transmitter or They will block at
	iio_buffer_refill(..) and iio_buffer_push(...) respectively.

	Remember that DMA transfers blocks at a time.
