This ADI AXI DMAC IIO client driver and test were created to ease transfer of
data between the PS and PL on Zynq and other such devices.

1) Required (Instructions on how build or deploy requirements not included):
	i)   Linux kernel from https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/linux
	     Ensure that dma_axi_dmac driver/module is built.

	ii)  ADI AXI DMAC PL IP with dependancies from
	     https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl/tree/master/library/axi_dmac

	iii) ADI libiio from https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio

2) Build:
	Edit make file and set the following:
		CROSS_CC to cross compiler or target compiler
		TARGET_ARCH to target
		TARGET_ROOT to target root for cross comiling or empty
		KERNELDIR to target kernel directory

3) PL & Devicetree Notes:
	See target.tcl for hints on how to design the PL portion.
	See target.dtsi on how to tell the kernel about the devices.

4) Test:
	Insert module and run test

5) Test Notes:
	When using iio_axi_dmac_test in a loopback configuration, remember to
	start both receiver and transmitter or They will block at
	iio_buffer_refill(..) and iio_buffer_push(...) respectively.

	Remember that DMA transfers blocks at a time.
